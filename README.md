# End of Degree Project: Differential Gene Expression Analysis.

**NOTE**: This repository contains all of the scripts I've created for my Bachelor's End of Degree Project. The main motivation is being able to share what I've done and serve as a way for me to gain experience with the git version control system and remote repositories. Thus, **don't expect any fully functional and mantained program**.

## Description

dgeapy.py is a script that tries to analyse Differential Gene Expression (DGE) data at a different levels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 (3.9+ preferably)
- Uses the following packages:
    - For the analysis:
        - [pandas](<https://pypi.org/project/pandas/>): dataframe analysis
        - [numpy](<https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>): computing
    - Data visualisation
        - [matplotlib](<https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>): low-level manipulations.
        - [seaborn](<https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/>): high-level manipulations.
        - [matplotlib-venn](<https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib-venn/>): venn diagram generation.
        - [UpSetPlot](<https://pypi.org/project/UpSetPlot/0.8.0/>): upset plot generation.
