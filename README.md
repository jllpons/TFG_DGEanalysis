# End of Degree Project: Differential Gene Expression Analysis.

**NOTE**: This repository contains all of the scripts I've created for my Bachelor's End of Degree Project. The main motivation is being able to share what I've done and serve as a way for me to gain experience with the git version control system and remote repositories. Thus, **don't expect any fully functional and mantained program**.

## Description

dgeapy.py is a script that tries to analyse Differential Gene Expression (DGE) data at a different levels.

## Prerequisites
